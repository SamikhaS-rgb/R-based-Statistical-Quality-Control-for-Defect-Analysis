# R-based-Statistical-Quality-Control-for-Defect-Analysis
This project performs Statistical Process Control using XÌ„, R, and S control charts in R. It includes detection of out-of-control subgroups, recalculation of control limits, and visualization of revised charts. Normality is assessed using the Anderson-Darling test with histogram and Q-Q plot diagnostics.
